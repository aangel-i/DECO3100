            <p>Social media plays a central role in our daily lives. It's how we stay connected with friends and family, have fun, and stay informed. In 2023, about 20% of Australians use social media as their primary news source (source). This percentage is much higher for younger Australians at around 46%, signalling a shift in how news is consumed by the emerging generation. This trend is not unique to Australia; it's a phenomenon observed globally.</p>

            <p>Our current digital era has transformed the accessibility of news, amplifying viewpoints that often go unheard in mainstream media. However, this shift has also fueled the spread of fake news on social media, resulting in significant real-world impacts. From the Capitol Riot to Pizzagate and Covid-19 misinformation, what began as a small hoax festering in the dark corners of the web have seeped into the public with harrowing consequences. How has social media allowed the escalation of radical belief fostered by fake news?</p>

            <p>Fake news is intentionally designed to hijack our attention with a surge of negative emotions. These emotions, particularly the negative ones, are crafted to bypass our rational thinking (source) through exploiting our human tendencies to negativity bias – the tendency for negative information and experiences to overwhelm positive ones (source). </p>
            <p>Social media platforms today wield powerful algorithms that craft a digital world tailored to your unique tastes, shaped by every like, share, and comment you make. However, this personalisation and interaction can inadvertently fuel the rapid spread of fake news.</p>
            <div id="interactionGraph"></div>
            <p>Negative emotions drive engagement with fake news, prompting algorithms to display more similar content on people’s feed once they interact with it. The more the algorithm pushes, the more people are trapped in a bubble where they are unable to differentiate truth from fiction. In addition, once a post gains traction on social media it is widely shared to other people’s feed and consequently ensnares unsuspecting users. </p>
            <div class= "quote">“ This type of behaviour has been rewarded in the past by algorithms that prioritise engagement when selecting which posts users see in their news feed, and by the structure and design of the sites themselves ”</div>
            <p>Governments globally recognise the harm of fake news and are creating legislation to counter it. Given the rapid pace of technological change, these measures may take time to influence society. Meanwhile, it's crucial for individuals to critically assess and engage with online news. Here are effective strategies to defend against fake news:</p>
            <p>Fake news is not a new phenomenon; it has existed ever since the creation of printed news. However, social media has exponentially increased its speed of spread and outreach. While social media has transformed our interaction with the news, it is imperative to approach the content we encounter critically. The rapid spread of fake news on these platforms can have tangible, far-reaching consequences in the real world. To safeguard our society, we must become vigilant gatekeepers of truth in our digital lives.</p>
